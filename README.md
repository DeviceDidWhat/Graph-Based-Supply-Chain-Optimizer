## 🧮 Algorithms Implemented

### 1. **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**
```python
def find_shortest_path(G, start_node, end_node):
    """
    Finds minimum cost path using Dijkstra's algorithm.
    Time Complexity: O((V + E) log V)
    """
    path = nx.dijkstra_path(G, source=start_node, target=end_node, weight='weight')
    cost = nx.dijkstra_path_length(G, source=start_node, target=end_node, weight='weight')
    return path, cost
```

**Use Case**: Finding the cheapest route to transport goods from supplier to store.

---

### 2. **Hungarian Algorithm (Kuhn-Munkres)**
```python
def find_optimal_assignment(G):
    """
    Solves minimum cost bipartite matching.
    Time Complexity: O(n³)
    """
    row_ind, col_ind = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)
    return assignments, total_cost
```

**Use Case**: Optimally pairing suppliers with warehouses to minimize total shipping cost.

---

### 3. **Yen's K-Shortest Paths**
```python
def find_k_shortest_paths(G, start_node, end_node, k=3):
    """
    Finds K shortest simple paths.
    Useful for backup routing.
    """
    for path in nx.shortest_simple_paths(G, start_node, end_node, weight='weight'):
        # Returns top K paths
```

**Use Case**: Providing alternative routes when primary path is congested or blocked.

---

### 4. **Betweenness Centrality**
```python
def find_critical_nodes(G, top_n=5):
    """
    Identifies nodes that appear in most shortest paths.
    Reveals network bottlenecks.
    """
    betweenness = nx.betweenness_centrality(G, weight='weight')
    return sorted_nodes
```

**Use Case**: Identifying which warehouses/hubs are most critical to network function.

---

### 5. **Maximum Flow (Ford-Fulkerson)**
```python
def calculate_network_flow(G, source_nodes, sink_nodes):
    """
    Computes maximum throughput capacity.
    Time Complexity: O(V * E²)
    """
    flow_value = nx.maximum_flow_value(G_flow, 'super_source', 'super_sink')
    return flow_value
```

**Use Case**: Determining maximum daily shipment capacity through the network.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for my company's actual supply chain?**
A: This is an educational prototype. For production use, consider enterprise solutions or extensive testing.

**Q: How do I add more nodes?**
A: Edit the `build_graph()` function in `optimizer.py` to add nodes and edges.

**Q: What if I want to optimize for time instead of cost?**
A: Change edge weights to represent time. The algorithms work the same way!

**Q: Can this handle cyclic routes?**
A: Yes, Dijkstra's algorithm handles cycles correctly. However, K-shortest paths finds only simple paths (no cycles).

**Q: How accurate is the resilience testing?**
A: It accurately models static network disruption. Real-world factors like partial capacity loss aren't modeled.
